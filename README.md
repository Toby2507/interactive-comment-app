## Overview

Frontend Interactive comment app built with React

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

- Setup my react project with create-react-app
- Divide page and functionalities into components
- Design the mobile version of the css
- Add functionlities ( I used react context api, useReducer, useEffect )
- Make the page responsive by adding desktop view
- Final house-keeping

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

While working on this project I became more proficient with the use of React hooks and context api. I'm more confident in my work and I learnt to make my code more streamlined and none repeatitive.

### Continued development

I plan to develve into the following framework/languages in the comming weeks:

- React-Redux
- React(Next.js)
- TypeScript
